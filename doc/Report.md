## Introduction 
In order to build a functioning programme in python, there are a few different tools at your disposal which can be used. 
This report will be reflecting on the tools I've used and not used before in order to successfully 
develop a working programme that demonstrates a scene with a walking panda. This will include GitHub, Command Line Controls, and IDEs.
## GitHub
GitHub is a great platform to use to publish, share, and edit projects for other people, and organisations which someone may
work for. Although GitHub isn't totally new to me as I've used this website in the past, I was introduced to some new functions I wasn't 
aware of such as SAML SSO. SAML and SSO which translates to Security Assertion Markup Language and Single Sign-on allow 
organisations a way to control and secure access to organisation resources like repositories, issues, and pull requests (About authentication with SAML single sign-on - GitHub Enterprise Cloud Docs, 2022).
For my project, I was instructed to use this function in order to allow Newcastle University to see my commits and pushes for my 
Walking Panda project. Furthermore, by using SAML and SSO I was able to copy the template which was already created by the 
organisation to kick-start my project. This tool I will certainly be using in the future. 


## Command Line Controls
In order to run some arguments in the Walking Panda project, I had to use Command Line Controls such as `python walking_panda.py --no-rotate`.
Previously when I programmed I did not use this tool. Command Line Control is the text that is inputted into the terminal section in PyCharm. 
Using the command previously stated in the terminal allowed the programme to run without the camera rotating which usually
happens if the programme is run normally without adding the argument. This is a useful feature, especially to test to see if 
arguments which were added work. Additionally, Command Line Controls can be used to access different directories and 
run other .py files directly which can save time, especially if the project that is being worked on is very large with lots of 
files inside. For example, to access the Walking Panda project I would use this command within the terminal `cd PycharmProjects/C2060506_csc1034_practical1_2022`
and then the command `python walking_panda.py` to run the programme.


## IDE
This tool isn't new to me, but during this project, I was exposed to tools within the IDE which are new to me. The IDE in this project 
was very useful, it allowed me to test my programme to see if it worked as intended, it also gave me suggestions while writing my 
programme which speeds up the process of writing the programme out. Not only did it assist with testing and suggesting code, but it also allowed
imports of various libraries such as Panda3D and playsound. 

## Conclusion
The tools spoken about in this report were all used in the development of the Walking Panda project, more so than others. Each tool
discussed has their own responsibility in their own right. For instance, GitHub is very useful for publishing files that include
code, licenses, and instructions on how to use the programme and on the other hand the IDE is where the programme is developed. 
Two very different tools, but each as important in the development process.
